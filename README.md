# VirtualCryptoTrading
####A java application that simulates trading with a wallet and live cryptocurrency data.

Any cryptocurrencies can be used with this project. A user will be able to create their own wallet by providing their name and choosing a username, as well as some other basic information. Their wallet will hold an account in USD that essentially provides the funding to which they can make their trades. 

You can also set a financial target or goals very much like a real portofolio and a statement will print to screen to inform them of this positive event. They will be able to view all their trades and be informed of their aggregate holdings as well.
