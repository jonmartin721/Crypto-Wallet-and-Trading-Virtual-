# VirtualCryptoTrading
#### A java application that simulates trading with a wallet and live cryptocurrency data.

In this project, any cryptocurrency can be bought or sold. A user will be able to create their own wallet by providing their name and choosing a username, as well as some other basic information. Their wallet will hold an account in USD that essentially provides the funding to which they can make their trades. 

You can also set a financial target or goals very much like a real portofolio and a statement will print to screen to inform them of this positive event. They will be able to view all their trades and be informed of their aggregate holdings as well.

The prototype version of this should be completed by the deadline Friday, 6 April, 2018.

We decided to challenge ourselves and really attempt something wholly and uniquely different but totally feasible especially in this digital age of online trading.  Your hear alot about cryptocurrencies but very little is understood.  

We have a very robust software developement life-cycle utilizing platforms like Github and syncing Github to IntelliJ, our chosen Java IDE. This has allowed us to work on our own code, on our own branch, and then merge that code into a "master" branch that is very close the final version of the code.  The classical chief programmer team approach has worked best for us with Jon Martin is the team lead.   

Our project is implemented using JDK 9 (we actually upgraded mid-implementation)  
Libraries we are using:
