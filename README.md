# VirtualCryptoTrading
#### A java application that simulates trading with a wallet and live cryptocurrency data.
#### The cryptocurrencies used for this project are BitCoin, Ehtereum, and LiteCoin. A user will be able to create their own "wallet" by providing their name and choosing a username.  Their wallet will hold an account in USD that essentially provides the funding to which they can make their trades. 
#### An added feature has been implementated that allows the user to set their own financial target or goals very much like a real portofolio and a statement will print to screen to inform them of this positive event.  They will be able to view all their trades and be informed of their aggregate holdings as well.
#### All their personal information will be encrypted and the log-in feature is authenticated.
